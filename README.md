## Hot update package for the flutter_eval code push app sample

This is the hot update package for the flutter_eval code push app sample. 
It is a Flutter package with dart_eval JSON bindings that we compile using 
the dart_eval CLI to produce the EVC update file that is consumed by the
code push app's HotSwapLoader. See the flutter_eval README for more details.
